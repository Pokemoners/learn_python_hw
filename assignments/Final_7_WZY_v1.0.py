# 1D NN ALGORITHM
# In 1D case, given a list of float elements and a query element, find the 
# nearest neighbor of the query element in the list. Further, use time.time() 
# method to compare how to improve the speed performance between:
# (1) Find nearest neighbor from an un-sorted list, and (2) Find nearest 
# neighbor from a sorted list.
# Can we find algorithms to have faster search speed when the list has 
# been sorted in the second scenario?
