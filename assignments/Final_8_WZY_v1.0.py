# CHECKMATE
# On a 4-by-8 half chess board, design a mini-game that lets the computer to 
# checkmate the human player. The rules are as follows:
# 1. The human plays the White King, which can move one-step at a time to any 
# of the 8 directions around the current position. The King starts at position 
# [0, 0]. The user inputs every move using the keyboard in the terminal.
# 2. The computer plays a Black Knight. The Knight starts at position [3, 7].
# 3. The computerâ€™s goal is to use the minimal number of steps to checkmate 
# the human. At the same time, the Knight can not be placed adjacent to the 
# King, otherwise the King will capture the Knight and the computer will lose.
# User the terminal print function to update the board situation about the 
# current positions of the two pieces after each human move and computer move, 
# respectively.
